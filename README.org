* Sample of passthrough with Post-Processing using Meta XR Core SDK
This repository contains sample source code to describe how to enable
Post-Processing with passthrough enabled.

 I'll post a blog entry that describes this later, but basically, I
 just added dedicated camera to render post-process effect, stack it
 on top of XRCameraRig's camera result.

** About license
This repository doesn't contains any code that I wrote. I attached
CC0-1.0 license file just because it's not good practice to leave any
repository without any license.
